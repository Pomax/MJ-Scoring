						<p class="smallcaps">how to use the scoring page</p>

						<p align="justify">Everytime someone wins a game, simply fill in what everyone has and hit "process hands". You
						fill out hands by typing the numbers of letters of their set into the boxes, so if someone has a
						pung white dragons, you fill in "ppp", or if someone has a chow 123 of characters, you fill in
						123 and click Ëê¨ next to it to indicate that it's from the characters suit. Alternatively, you can type
						'B', 'C' or 'D' to have the script auto-set the suit to 'bamboo', 'characters' or 'dots' respectively</p>

						<p align="justify">You don't need to indicate whether something is a pung/kong of terminals, because obviously
						filling in "1111" or "999" should already be enough information for the system, but you do need
						to click the concealed checkbox if you had any set in your hand rather than on the table. However,
						if someone won by a limithand, instead of filling out their hand simply select the limithand that they
						won on first, then click the "limithand" option for that player. Fill in other players as usual.</p>

						<p align="justify">While for the winner you need to fill in everything they had (so that the system knows who
						won, because only the winner has a mahjong forming collection of tiles), you can ignore chows
						and pairs that generate no points when filling out the other players, since they won't matter
						to the score calculation anyway.</p>
